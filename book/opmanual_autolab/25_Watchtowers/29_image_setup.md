The image setup procedure for Watchtowers is the same as for Duckiebots.

In the Autolab of ETH Zurich, the Watchtowers have username **mom**, hostname **watchtowerXX** (where XX specify the number of the Watchtower.) and password **MomWatches**.

Using the above naming conventions, you can flash your SD cards as is described in [Duckiebot Initialization](+opmanual_duckiebot#setup-duckiebot).
