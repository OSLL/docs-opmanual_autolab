### Prerequisite recommendation {#dt-env-developer}

If you are building an Autolab, you are a committed developer of Duckietown. We thus strongly suggest that your workflow for software should follow the standard one, using `dt-env-developer`. This is a meta repository that aggregates, with the myrepos tool, the different repositories of code that developers use daily.

To set it up, follow the [README instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-env-developer). We strongly recommend using ubuntu 18.04. To set up the computer, follow the instructions [here](+opmanual_duckiebot#laptop-setup).

Once it is setup, it will make yor life easier to understand which code is relevant or not. The rest of this book will assume that you set it up this way, but also each thereafter mentioned repository can be clone on its own and used as usual.
