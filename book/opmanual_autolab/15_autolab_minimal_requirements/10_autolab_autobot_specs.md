## Flashing the autobots

For a functional autolab, we strongly recommend using names of the type :

- autobotXX (with XX starting at 01)

The autobot part can be changed, but the numbers at the end make the whole autolab code easier to use and maintain.

To flash the autobots sd cards, follow the instructions [here](+opmanual_duckiebot#setup-duckiebot).

## Adding hardware to the bot

### For autocharging

Follow instructions [here](#autocharging-current-collector).

### For localization
