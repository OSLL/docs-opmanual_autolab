### Prerequisite recommendation {#dt-env-developer}
If you are building an Autolab, you are a committed developer of Duckietown. We strongly recommend using Ubuntu 18.04. To set up the computer, follow the instructions [here](+opmanual_duckiebot#laptop-setup). 

We suggest that your workflow for software should follow the standard one, using [`dt-env-developer`]((https://github.com/duckietown/dt-env-developer)). This is a meta repository that aggregates, with the myrepos tool, the different repositories of code that developers use daily. To set it up, follow the [README instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-env-developer). The rest of this book will assume that you set it up this way, but you could also clone each individual repository on its own and use it as usual.
