Warning: Autolabs are still experimental. We are working on preparing a set of instructions for you but it is still all in its beta version.  


### The Big Picture {nonumber notoc}

The goal of an Autolab is to create a human free, automated environment for Duckiebots. This requires a bit more than just a standard [Duckietown](+opmanual_duckietown#book) to work.

An Autolab can serve different purposes. It is used for research on the Duckietown platform, and is also being used to organize the embodied challenges of [AIDO]((+AIDO#book)).

The aim of this book is to present:

- a set of instructions (labeled BUILDING) on how to build an Autolab to current specifications
- a set of instructions (labeled DEMO) on how to run the Autolab functions or demos
- a set of guides (labeled SOFTWARE) to the different pieces of software that are used and are under development

### Sections

In each of the following sections you will find the BUILDING, the DEMO and the SOFTWARE pages.

You can find the up-to-date status of each page of the book at the top-right of the page, that will change as we write them down. Please only refer to those marked as either BETA or READY.
