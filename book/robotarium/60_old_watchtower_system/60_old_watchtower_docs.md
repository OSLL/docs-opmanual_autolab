# Old watchtower docs {#part:autolab-old-localization status=beta}


The autolab needs an integrated localization system. This system currently relies on watchtowers and april tags.

Watchtowers enable the actual Duckietown city to sense what is going on in its roads.

Note: Watchtowers are an experimental feature of Duckietown, which are currently only used in Robotariums.
