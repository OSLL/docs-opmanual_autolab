# The Autolab {#book:autolab status=ready}

Note: Autolabs are currently under development. The naming is not fixed yet, and you might find references to the robotarium, which is the same thing as the autolab.

**The big picture**

The goal of an autolab is to create a human free, automated environment for duckiebots. This requires a bit more than just a standard [Duckietown](+duckietowns#book:duckietowns) to work. An autolab can serve different purposes. It is daily used for research on the duckietown platform, and is also being used to organize the embodied challenges of AIDO.
