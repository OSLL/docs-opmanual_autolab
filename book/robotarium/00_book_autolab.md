# The Autolab {#book:autolab status=draft}



## The big picture

The goal of an autolab is to create a human free, automated environment for duckiebots. This requires a bit more than just a standard [Duckietown](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietowns) to work. 

An autolab can serve different purposes. It is daily used for research on the duckietown platform, and is also being used to organize the embodied challenges of AIDO.

The aim of this book is to present:

- a set of instructions on how to build an autolab to current specifications
- a set of instructions on how to run the autolab functions or demos
- a set of guides to the different pieces of software that are used and are under development

## The sections

- [](#autolab-definition) : The precise definition of an Autolab
- [](#autolab-auto-charging) : The set of instruction on how to build and operate an autocharging station
- [](#autolab-localization) : The set of instruction on how to build and operate the localization system
- [](#autolab-operation-manual) : The set of instructions on how to operate the whole Autolab


**Keywords**: robotics, safety-critical AI, self-driving cars, autonomous mobility on demand.

Note: Autolabs are currently under development. The naming is not fixed yet, and you might find references to the robotarium, which is the same thing as the autolab.
