# The Autolab {#book:autolab status=draft}

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: A fully operational [Duckietown](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietowns)

Results: A working Autolab
</div>



## The big picture

The goal of an autolab is to create a human free, automated environment for duckiebots. This requires a bit more than just a standard [Duckietown](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietowns) to work. 

An autolab can serve different purposes. It is daily used for research on the duckietown platform, and is also being used to organize the embodied challenges of [AIDO]((+AIDO#AIDO)).

___

The aim of this book is to present:

- a set of instructions (labeled BUILDING) on how to build an autolab to current specifications
- a set of instructions (labeled DEMO) on how to run the autolab functions or demos
- a set of guides (labeled SOFTWARE) to the different pieces of software that are used and are under development

## The sections

In each of the following sections you will find the BUILDING, the DEMOs and the SOFTWARE pages.

In the description introduction of each part will be the up-to-date status of each page of the book, that will change as we write them down. Please only refer to those marked as BETA or as READY. 

- [](#autolab-definition) : The precise definition of an Autolab
- [](#autolab-auto-charging) : The set of instruction on how to build and operate an autocharging station
- [](#autolab-localization) : The set of instruction on how to build and operate the localization system
- [](#autolab-operation-manual) : The set of instructions on how to operate the whole Autolab


**Keywords**: robotics, safety-critical AI, self-driving cars, autonomous mobility on demand.

Note: Autolabs are currently under development. The naming is not fixed yet, and you might find references to the robotarium, which is the same thing as the autolab.
