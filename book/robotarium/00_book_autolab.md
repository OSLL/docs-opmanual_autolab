# The Autolab {#book:autolab status=ready}

Note: Autolabs are currently under development. The naming is not fixed yet, and you might find references to the robotarium, which is the same thing as the autolab.

**The big picture**

The goal of an autolab is to create a human free, automated environment for duckiebots. This requires a bit more than just a standard [Duckietown](+duckietowns#dt-ops-preliminaries) to work.

The aim of this book is to present:

- a set of instructions on how to build an autolab to current specifications
- a set of instructions on how to run the autolab functions or demos
- guides to the software that is used and under development

, see [](#fig:Autolab).

The following documentation shall give an overview about how things are going to be built and operated for further development and improvements.
