# Future projects {#autocharging-future status=beta}

There are still multiple tasks which would improve the charging area by a lot. In the following, you find a list of those tasks with a small description, ordered in descending priority.

## Improve the intersection navigation

For traversing through the maintenance area, intersection navigation is a crucial part. With the new Unicorn Intersection Node, the success rate was raised up to over 90%. For a completely autonomous city, this is still way too low.

## Provide a flatter surface

With the original tiles, it is almost impossible to obtain a nice flat surface. This is the reason why sometimes a Duckiebot gets stuck or loses contact. An idea would be to replace the charging tiles with a black and flat surface (like sprayed wood) and tape the lines directly on it.

## Improve the vehicle detection

In order to keep distance to a Duckiebot in front, the vehicle avoidance node detects a circle grid pattern ($7 \times 3$) and adapts the velocity. However, the detection only runs at $2Hz$ and fails sometimes.

## Optimize CPU utilization

Currently, CPU utilization is at 100% for all four cores. The most expensive node seems to be the Image Transformer Node which uses alone 40% of the CPU. This slows down the whole megacity.launch and could be cause for multiple bugs.

## Implement the battery capacity estimation

Currently, the time a Duckiebot drives through the city and stays inside a charger are hard coded variables. With a high enough charging time and a low enough driving time, it is ensured that a Duckiebot never reaches a battery level of 0%. The drawback is that the efficiency in terms of the ratio $\frac {driving time}{charging time}$ is very low. This can be improved by implementing the battery capacity estimation: with the new add-on board, one is able to measure the current going into the battery and therefore integrate it to obtain the battery level.


## Improve the TCP Communication Node

With the introduction of a charging station, communication between different Duckiebots outside of intersections became crucial. This is why we developed the TCP Communication Node: Every time a Duckiebot goes charging, it finds a free spot by asking a centralized server and reserves it. When the Duckiebot finishes charging, it releases that spot again.

This node was not tested enough and may have some bugs which need to be fixed. Also, if a Duckiebot is killed while charging (unplug the Raspberry pi without terminating ROS with CTRL+C), a charging spot is used by a Duckiebot phantom. This phantom can only be removed by connecting to the TCP server and manually adjusting the variable.

## Fix the stop line sleep time

In order to avoid stopping at the red line in opposite direction right after an intersection, there is a stop line sleep time implemented. This however does not work robustly - sometimes, that "bad" red line is still detected.

## Proper shutdown procedure

After launching megacity for multiple times, it seems as if the CPU is getting slower. This could either be caused by the increase of temperature of the CPU or by the fact that not all python scripts are terminated when hitting CTRL+C.

## Provide tiles that are more flat

With the original tiles, it is almost impossible to obtain a nice flat surface. This is the reason why sometimes a Duckiebot gets stuck or loses contact. An idea would be to replace the charging tiles with a black and flat surface (like sprayed wood) and tape the lines directly on it.

## Consider a cooling system

After operating the Duckiebot for a long time, the Raspberry Pi gets really hot at its interfaces (USB plugs, LAN Port, etc). For a 24/7 operating time that can influence the behavior of the Duckiebot a lot. If one would cool the Duckiebot actively by a little fan, the temperature wouldn't increase that much.

## Implement a fault detection

In order being able to act as soon as possible when a fault occurs on the charging station, a monitor system which enables the user to have a remote control over the whole auto-charging system could be developped. Then someone could for instance get a mail to clear a fault.
