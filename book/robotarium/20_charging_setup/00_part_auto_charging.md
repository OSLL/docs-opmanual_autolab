Duckiebots have a limited battery capacity. Therefore to create a fully autonomous Duckietown, a charging station is a crucial part. This chapter describes how to setup and operate a charging area. It is highly recommended to have a 3D-printer available in order to tune the flexibility of some parts - if this is not the case, URLs for ordering the parts are provided.

Please keep in mind that this solution is still not perfect - in [](#autocharging-future), you find the issues which should be solved next.
