## Traffic lights

Traffic lights are made of a 4 way LED system, place on top of three ways and four ways intersections. Each led is controlled in color and in blinking frequency. 
There behave like traditional traffic lights: they turn green, the yellow, then red. Only one of the 4 lights is green at a time.
