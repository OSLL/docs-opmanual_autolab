# The Autolab {#book:autolab status=ready}

Note: Autolabs are currently under development. The naming is not fixed yet, and you might find references to the robotarium, which is the same thing as the autolab.

An Autolab consists of a Duckietown and a maintenance area. These two elements must be connected by a single road, see [](#fig:Autolab).

The following documentation shall give an overview about how things are going to be built and operated for further development and improvements.
